# CNC Files

Use you favorite CAM software to generate the G Codes for you milling machine. I'm using [Estlcam](http://www.estlcam.com/) to generate the files for my [Stepcraft 420](https://www.stepcraft-systems.com/en/).

My machine is able to mill acrylic glass under water up to 30cm x 15cm. Three acrylic glass sheets are necessary to mill 4 * 10 digits and for smaller pieces with dots. first the digits are milled using a 45Â° graver, then use a 2mm milling tool to cut out the pieces.
